Synergy
=================================

In oncology, combination therapy of two drugs can be more effective than single drugs alone. 
Often, the combination of two drugs produces an additive effect, but occasionally the effect of the drugs together is more than the sum of either drug on its own (i.e. synergistic).
As synergistic drug combinations are promising clinical candidates, many deep learning models have been created and published to predict whether a combination of two drugs will be synergistic.
However, like Drug Response Prediction models, there has been no standardized way to compare models. 
Here, we use the IMPROVE framework to benchmark and compare various synergy models with a set Benchmark Data for this scientific question. 
We have curated 2 community synergy models into the IMPROVE framework currently.
