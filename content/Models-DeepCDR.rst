=================
Cancer Drug Response Prediction via a Hybrid Graph Convolutional Network

Model Architecture
--------------------
DeepCDR is a hybrid graph convolutional network for cancer drug response prediction. It takes both multi-omics data of cancer cell lines and drug structure as inputs and predicts the drug sensitivity (binary or contineous IC50 value).
