Cancer Drug Response Prediction via a Hybrid Graph Convolutional Network

Model Architecture
--------------------
DeepCDR is a hybrid graph convolutional neural network (GCN) that has been developed for drug response prediction that uses both drug features, and multiomics features. This network consists of a uniform graph convolution network (UGCN) for accommodating drug-level features, which respects the structures of the chemical components of drugs, and several subnetworks for extracting cancer cell line information.
