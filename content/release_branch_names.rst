GitHub Branch & Tag Names
===========================

Tags
------

Release tags will be used to mark specific software versions. Models released with a particular tag are compatible with the corresponding version (same tag) of the improvelib package. Release tags follow the vX.X.X semantic versioning format.


Branches
----------

IMPROVE repo:
* master - The latest stable version of the code. This branch will be used to tag version releases.
* develop - The primary development branch. Features and bug fixes are merged into develop before being considered for release.

Curated models:
* original - The original forked code.
