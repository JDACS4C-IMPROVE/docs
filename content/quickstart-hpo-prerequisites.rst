Installing git and singularity
_____________________________________

Please refer to the documentation of the tools for install instructions.

Installing conda
_____________________________________

To check if you have conda, use ``conda --version``.

If you do not have conda installed, install with the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    source ~/.bashrc

Now, using the ``conda --version`` command should give the version you've downloaded. If not, close the terminal session and open again, then try ``conda --version``.


Installing supervisor
_____________________

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create --name IMPROVE python=3.9.16
    conda activate IMPROVE
    git clone https://github.com/ECP-CANDLE/Supervisor.git
    cd Supervisor && export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/bin
    git checkout develop
    pip install numpy deap




Installing swift-t
_____________________

You need to be in conda environment to proceed. If you arenâ€™t sure: ::

    # Same conda env than above
    # conda create --name IMPROVE python=3.9.16
    conda activate IMPROVE

Install swift-t via conda. For detailed instructions please refer to the `swift-t documentation <http://swift-lang.github.io/swift-t/guide.html>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install --yes -c conda-forge -c swift-t swift-t


Shared installations
--------------------

The `supervisor` tool supports shared installations.  For example, a site administrator can install all of the tools above in a public location.  The user should be able to run `supervisor` from a personal directory with all configuration files and output files there.

Setting up a new site
---------------------

On a simple Linux system, you will simply need to modify `Supervisor/workflows/common/sh/env-local.sh` to specify the software locations on your system.

For more complex systems, you will also need to provide scheduler settings in the `sched-SITE.sh` script.

See the `supervisor tool doc <https://github.com/ECP-CANDLE/Supervisor/tree/develop/bin/#quickstart>` for more details about how to configure a site.
