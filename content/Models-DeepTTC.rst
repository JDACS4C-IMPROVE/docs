DeepTTC
=================
A transformer-based model for predicting cancer drug response

Model Architecture
--------------------
DeepTTC is an end-to-end deep learning model to predict the anti-cancer drug response. DeepTTC takes gene expression data and chemical strcutures of drug for drug response prediction. Specifically, get inspiration from natural language processing, DeepTTC use transformer for drug representation learning.
