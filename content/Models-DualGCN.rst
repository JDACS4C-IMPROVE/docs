A dual graph convolutional network model to predict cancer drug response


Model Architecture
--------------------
DualGCN is a unified Dual Graph Convolutional Network model to predict cancer drug response. It takes chemical structure information of a drug and gene features of a cancer sample as inputs and outputs IC50.
