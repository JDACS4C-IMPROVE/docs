Benchmark Evaluation Schemes
=================

With the recent explosion in the number and diversity of supervised learning models, there is a need for standardized evaluation schemes and datasets to benchmark models. We are creating both benchmark datasets and benchmark evaluation schemes as part of the IMPROVE framework, beginning with Drug Response Prediction.


General benchmark data set structure

We currently have benchmark data for :ref: `Drug Response Prediction <CSA_Benchmark_Datasets>`.
