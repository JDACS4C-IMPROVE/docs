Intro/why

General benchmark data set structure

We currently have benchmark data for:
Drug Response Prediction - link


IMPROVE Benchmark Evaluation Schemes
---------------------------------------
Cross-study generalization (ability of models to generalize across cell-line datasets)
Learning curve (data scaling properties)
Cell-blind analysis (ability to make good drug recommendations given a cancer sample)
