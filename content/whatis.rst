What is the IMPROVE project?
============================
IMPROVE aims to establish methodology to systematically and rigorously compare supervised learning models. To this end, IMPROVE has two components:

1) IMPROVE Framework: standardized scaffolding for machine learning models, written in Python

2) IMPROVE Benchmark Datasets: a collection of standardized data for each application to allow for benchmarking of models

3) IMPROVE Evaluation Schemes: workflows to evaluated and compare models

4) IMPROVE Community Curated Models: models from the scientific communitity that have been curated into the IMPROVE framework


IMPROVE can be applied to a variety of supervised learning models. We have begun with the Drug Response Prediction problem, standardizing community models that predict pan-cancer, pan-drug, single drug response for precision oncology with a standardized benchmark dataset.
