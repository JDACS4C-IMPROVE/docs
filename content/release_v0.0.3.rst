Release v0.0.3
=================================

Version 0.3.0-beta introduces essential functionalities for structuring prediction models in a standardized format, enabling the use of curated models that conform to the required code structure with our benchmark dataset. 
A critical feature of this version is the refactoring of code to separate preprocessing, training, and inference into distinct model scripts, enhancing modularity and flexibility. 
This version has been employed to adapt the code structure of twelve community DRP models, covering a diverse range of model architectures, data representations, and learning schemes. 
These models can now be integrated with the developed workflows for Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) and Cross-Study Analysis (CSA).
