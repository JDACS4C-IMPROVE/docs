LGBM uses the LightGBM gradient boosting framework to predict drug response from gene expression of cancer cell lines and drug features. It is an efficient tree based learning algorithm.

Feature Representation
-------------------------

   * Cancer features: 

      * Gene Expression

   * Drug features: 

       * Drug Fingerprints
