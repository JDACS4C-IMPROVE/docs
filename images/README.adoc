== Supervisor images

`SV` means Supervisor.

The `arch` figures are a high-level overview of what Supervisor does.

The `code` figures show something more like reality.  These component blocks correspond to real scripts.

The `test` figures refer to the older test-driven development approach, in which the user would reuse or write and run a `test` script that would load up settings and invoke the Workflow Shell (`workflow.sh`).

The `tool` figures refer to the newer tool-driven approach, in which the user invokes the `supervisor` command-line tool against a `cfg` script.  Other settings are loaded via `SUPERVISOR_PATH`.
