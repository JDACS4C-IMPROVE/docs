Prerequisites HPO
=================

- `git <https://github.com>`_
- `conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`_
- `singularity <https://apptainer.org>`_
- `swift-t <https://github.com/swift-lang/swift-t>`_
- `Supervisor <https://github.com/ECP-CANDLE/Supervisor>`_


Installing git and singularity
_____________________________________

Please refer to the documentation of the tools for install instructions.

Installing conda
_____________________________________

To check if you have conda, use ``conda --version``.

If you do not have conda installed, install with the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    source ~/.bashrc

Now, using the ``conda --version`` command should give the version you've downloaded. If not, close the terminal session and open again, then try ``conda --version``.


Installing supervisor
_____________________

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create --name IMPROVE python=3.9.16
    conda activate IMPROVE
    git clone https://github.com/ECP-CANDLE/Supervisor.git
    cd Supervisor && export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/bin
    git checkout develop
    pip install numpy deap


Environment for HPO
_____________________

If on a job-submitting computation system, it's important that the IMPROVE environment is activated for the job. This may require you to add the following line to your ``~/.bashrc`` file, which changes your default login environment: ``conda activate IMPROVE``. Here's an example of how your the end of your ``~/.bashrc`` file might look:

.. code-block:: bash

    # >>> conda initialize >>>
    # !! Contents within this block are managed by 'conda init' !!
    __conda_setup="$('/home/weaverr/miniconda3/bin/conda' 'shell.bash' 'hook' 2> /dev/null)"
    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
        eval "$__conda_setup"
    else
        if [ -f "/home/weaverr/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh" ]; then
            . "/home/weaverr/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh"
        else
            export PATH="/home/weaverr/miniconda3/bin:$PATH"
        fi
    fi
    unset __conda_setup
    # <<< conda initialize <<<
    
    conda activate IMPROVE

After this change, you will need to enter ``source ~/.bashrc`` again to update.


Installing swift-t
_____________________

You need to be in conda environment to proceed. If you arenâ€™t sure: ::
 
    # Same conda env than above
    # conda create --name IMPROVE python=3.9.16
    conda activate IMPROVE

Install swift-t via conda. For detailed instructions please refer to the `swift-t documentation <http://swift-lang.github.io/swift-t/guide.html>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install --yes -c conda-forge -c swift-t swift-t

Shared installations
--------------------

The ``supervisor`` tool supports shared installations.  For example, a site administrator can install all of the tools above in a public location.  The user should be able to run ``supervisor`` from a personal directory with all configuration files and output files there.

Setting up a new site
---------------------

| On a simple Linux system, you will simply need to modify
| ``Supervisor/workflows/common/sh/env-local.sh``
| to specify the software locations on your system.

For more complex systems, you will also need to provide scheduler settings in the ``sched-SITE.sh`` script.

See the `supervisor tool doc <https://github.com/ECP-CANDLE/Supervisor/tree/develop/bin/#quickstart>`_ for more details about how to configure a site.
