.. The IMPROVE (Innovative Methodologies and New Data for Predictive Oncology Model Evaluation) project is dedicated to standardizing execution of prediction models, facilitating rigorous benchmarking and fair comparison of models. The IMPROVE software stack is a collection of python-based tools for standardizing model codes as well as workflowsfor executing model evaluation and compairsons at scale. As a seminal case, we have curated community models and a benchmark dataset for monotherapy drug response prediction. Do you have a model you would like to compare with other state-of-the-art models? Try IMPROVE!

The IMPROVE (Innovative Methodologies and New Data for Predictive Oncology Model Evaluation) project is dedicated to standardizing the execution of prediction models, enabling rigorous benchmarking and fair comparison.
The IMPROVE software stack offers Python-based tools for standardizing model code structure, along with workflows for large-scale model evaluation and comparison.

We have been using anti-cancer drug response prediction (DRP) as a use case to drive the development of the IMPROVE software. As part of this effort, we have curated DRP community models to conform to a standardized structure and compiled a benchmark dataset for monotherapy DRP.

Want to benchmark your model against others in the community? Try IMPROVE!
