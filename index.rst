Welcome to IMPROVE's documentation!
===================================

.. warning:: v0.0.3-beta

   This documentation is for a previous release of IMPROVE. 

The IMPROVE project aims to standardize execution of supervised learning models to facilitate benchmarking and comparison of models. We have created a Python-based IMPROVE framework that encases community models and IMPROVE benchmarking schemes for model comparision. As a seminal case, we have curated community models and a benchmark dataset for single drug response prediction. Do you have a model you would like to easily compare to state-of-the-art models? Try IMPROVE!
